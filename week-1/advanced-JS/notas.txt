Prototype property (every object has): 
- Wich makes inheritance possible in JS. 
- The protoype property of an object is where we put methods and properties taht we want other object to inherit.
- The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself, it's the prototype of ALL instances that 
are created through it

Prototype Chain: When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found,
the search moves on to the object's prototype. This continues until the method is found.

--> Difference between Object.create and the function constructor:
Is that object.create builds an object that inherits directly from the one that we passed into the first argument.
While, on the other hand, the function constructor the newly created object inherits from the constructor's prototype property

--> Primitives vs. Objects
Variables containing primitives actually hold that data inside of the variable itself.
On Objects, variables associated with objects DO NOT actually contain the object , but instead contain a reference to the place 
in memory where the object sits, so where the object is stored
